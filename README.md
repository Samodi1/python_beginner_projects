# Python Beginner Projects

## Overview

This project contains two beginner-friendly Python mini-projects:

1. Personal Budget Tracker
2. Simple Contact Manager

Each project focuses on applying core Python concepts in a real-life scenario.

---

## Learning Goals

By completing these projects, you will:

- Understand and use Python data types (strings, integers, booleans, lists, dictionaries, etc.)
- Write and call functions and methods
- Use control flow (if/else, for and while loops)
- Create and use Python classes and objects
- Work with class inheritance (optional)
- Read from and write to text files
- Use input() for user interaction
- Import classes/modules from other Python files

---

## Instructions

1. Choose your group project (Budget Tracker or Contact Manager).
2. Open the project files in your code editor.
3. Look for # TODO: commentsâ€”these show where you must write code.
4. Implement the required methods, especially __init__ and __str__ in the classes.
5. Run and test your code using `main_budget.py` or `main_contact.py`.
6. Make sure it can save and load data from a file.

## Reminders

- Do not copy/paste solutions. Try to solve the problems yourself.
- Ask for help only after giving it a good try.
- Use print() to test your functions and debug.

Good luck, and enjoy coding!
